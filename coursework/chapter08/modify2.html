	Purpose:Chapter 8 Exercise

		modify2.html does not need to be changed. Change modify2.php
		so that if the entire party (adults and children) is at least
		10 there is a 15.00 discount, and if the entire party is at
		least 6 there is a 10.00 discount.
		So for example, tickets for a party of 2 adults and 2 children
		will cost $22.00
		tickets for a party of 6 adults and 4 children
		will cost $42.00
		tickets for a party of 4 adults and 2 children
		will cost $25.00
